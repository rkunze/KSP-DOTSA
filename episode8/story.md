# Year 1, Day 93: Pathfinder III Debris Reentry

After more than three days in space, the orbit of the spent upper stage from the launch of Pathfinder III decayed far enough that tracking predicted final reentry into Kerbins atmosphere within the next 5 hours.

As predicted, at around 11:00 — late afternoon at the KSC — the spent Satevis stage reentered Kerbins atmosphere, a bit east of the KSC.

And painted a fiery streak across the afternoon sky. Bright enough to be seen even in daylight.

But — contrary to the expectations of most — the debris did not burn up. Instead, it continued on over the sea, and finally crashed down into the ocean well east of Welcome Back Island.
