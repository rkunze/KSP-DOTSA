# Dawn of the Space Age
## A history of the Kerbinian Society for Astronavigation

They finally made it. 

Almost a decade after founding the Kerbinian Society for
Astronavigation, after almost endless discussions, research, planning, more
discussions, scrabbling for money, lobbying, convincing investors and sponsors,
calling in all favors any of them were owed (and now owing quite a lot of
favors themselves), they finally had a launch site and research center. A former
aircraft test site, conveniently located in the middle of nowhere (but smack on
the equator!), complete with runway, hangar (a bit decrepit, admittedly), a
small office building and a shed (now serving as mission control and admin
office), a barracks building (newly renamed to "Astronaut Complex", and
their home for the forseeable future) and a couple of nissen huts clustered
around another office building (the "Science Center"). Always optimistic, they
changed its old name to "Kerbin Spaceport Complex" (and to be honest, that does
sound better than "Aeroplane Research Site Four"), and spent almost all of the
societies' remaining funds on a brand new rocket assembly building
(planned for a bright future, and way too large for what they could actually
build) and a tracking station. And, of course, a launch pad (to be brutally
honest this time, really just a patch of roughly graded dirt hopefully far
enough away from everything else that accidents could happen without causing too
much damage).

Who they were? A bunch of eccentrics, convinced that it was possible to use
rockets to not only leave Kerbins atmosphere, but to actually "fall around the
world" and stay up in the skies forever. And to go even further, to Kerbins
moons, to other planets, and even other stars! The "space fool Kermans", they
were sometimes called (and yes, even though Kerman is a very common name, there
were an unusual number of Kermans in the society). Wernher von Kerman. Jebediah
Kerman (no relation to Wernher). Gene and Mortimer Kerman (cousins, but not
related to either Wernher or Jeb). Max Kalier. Robert Krussel. And last but by
no means least, Valentina Korova. 

The founding members of the Kerbinian Society for Astronavigation.

And as of today — day one of year one of the space age, because of course they
had started a new year count for the occasion, in good kerbinian tradition —
they were officially in business. The business of guiding Kerbalkind to the
stars, as stated in the societies' bylaws.
