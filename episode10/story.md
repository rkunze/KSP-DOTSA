# Year 1, Day 120: Pathfinder IV

To avoid a recurrence of the infamous antenna incident, measures had been taken for Pathfinder IV: On the hardware side, a long(er) range antenna was retrofitted on the Satevis stage. And on the software side, the flight plan had been changed to keep Pathfinder IV attached to the Satevis stage until apoapsis instead of separating directly after orbital injection — mainly to take advantage of the solar cells on Pathfinder IV to keep the Satevis' batteries from draining (and maybe even recharge them a bit) on the long way to apoapsis.

All of this had taken a bit longer than planned. But finally, on 001/120 at 06:30 in the morning, Pathfinder IV sits on the pad, ready for launch.

Pathfinder IV roars into the morning sky.

At an altitude of just above 40000 m, and just passing over Welcome Back Island, the Sandstone tanks are empty and the main engine cuts off.

Just one minute later, at 70000 m over the ocean, fairings and the spent Sandstone booster are jettisoned.

After coasting to its (temporary) apoapsis at 95 km, the Satevis SRB ignites as planned and hurls Pathfinder IV into its final orbit.

After Satevis burns out, the guidance program orients the whole vehicle normal to the orbital plane to catch as much sunlight on the solar cells as possible, spins it up to stabilize the orientation, and shuts almost every system down. The sole exception is a single radio receiver listening for a wakeup signal.

While Pathfinder IV coasts to its final apoapsis at just below 10000 km,the launch crew repairs to the cafeteria for a well-earned break for snacks and kaffee (thankfully, sans impromptu emergency planning sessions this time), where they meet the science crew — who will be responsible for Pathfinder IV after separation from Satevis — enjoying a leisurely breakfast.

At midday, everyone is back in mission control, and the launch crew sends the signal that powers on the guidance computer on Satevis again.

At T+02:49:14, the guidance computer reboots, detects that it is no longer on the launch pad, and proceeds to separate Satevis from Pathfinder IV. The launch team hands over control of Pathfinder IV to the science team.

After delivering its payload, the spent Satevis stage aligns itself prograde again, coasts to apoapsis, fires four small solid fuel retro rockets and shuts down. Exactly as planned.

Just a little push, a mere 22 m/s ΔV. But enough to make sure the spent booster will burn up in Kerbins atmosphere instead of cluttering up the sky above Kerbin.

Meanwhile, the science crew takes control of Pathfinder IV, and immediately gets busy preparing it for it scientific mission: Measuring gamma rays in space over Kerbin.
